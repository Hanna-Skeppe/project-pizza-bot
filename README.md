# Pizza Bot

The basic requirements for this project was to make a pizza bot using Javascript and to show the final order summary visually using prompts.
The intermediary requirements included to make an HTML form and connect it to the Javascript.
We completed the blue level and aimed at the red level. 

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? 
We started coding the project in the beginning of the week when we hadn't had so much time to practice and learn Javascript basics. This proved to be a challange writing the code and simultaneously reading up on the material.
We both had no prior knowledge of Javascript starting this project. Something we found helpful learning js basics was a Codecademy course that ran through the basics of Javascript, which we did parallell to the project.
Because we har different life/work situations we didn't have the same amount of time to put in to the project. 
We think that the pair-programming worked really well, and we learned a lot from each other.
Considering the above, we are in the end very pleased with how the end result turned out. But we feel that we have to continue to read up more on Javascript to be more comfortable in js basics. 
For this project we din't focus a lot on the CSS styling, because we felt that ou time was best spent trying to grasp Javascript basics. We did add some styling and an animation though.

If you had more time, what would be next?
If we had more time, we would have also specified different prices to the pizzas. We find that making even small changes like this is quite complicated and takes much time, which we don't have right now.
