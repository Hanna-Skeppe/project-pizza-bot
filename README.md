# Pizza Bot

The basic requirements for this project was to make a pizza bot using Javascript and to show the final order summary visually using prompts.
The intermediary requirements included to make an HTML form and connect it to the Javascript.
This project is part of Technigo bootcamp. Thw project was made in pairs.

## Tech Used
HTML, CSS, Javascript.

## The problem

We started coding the project in the beginning of the week when we hadn't had so much time to practice and learn Javascript basics. This proved to be a challange writing the code and simultaneously reading up on the material.
We both had no prior knowledge of Javascript starting this project. Something we found helpful learning JS basics was a Codecademy course that ran through the basics of Javascript, which we did parallell to the project.
We think that the pair-programming worked really well, and we learned a lot from each other.
Considering the above, we are in the end very pleased with how the end result turned out. 
For this project we din't focus a lot on the CSS styling, because we felt that our time was best spent trying to grasp as much Javascript basics as possible. We did add some styling and an animation though.

If we had more time, we would have also specified different prices to the pizzas.
